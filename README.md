# fadingblur

A demo project showing how the fading out effect can be achieved on a view with any kind of background (blurred, opaque, semi-transparent, multi-color or clear).

Also providing a UIView subclass `FadingEdgesView` that can be used as a drop-in view class to fade its subviews. Edges to fade and insets (at which points fading actually kicks in) can be customized.
